## Description

This Android app utilizes TensorFlow Lite, a framework for deploying machine learning models on mobile devices, to perform image classification. Image classification is the task of identifying what an image represents, and TensorFlow Lite provides optimized pre-trained models for deployment in mobile applications. The app allows users to capture or select an image from their device, and it provides information or performs actions based on the recognized content.

## TensorFlow Lite and Image Classification

During training, an image classification model is fed images and their associated labels. Each label represents a distinct concept or class that the model learns to recognize. TensorFlow Lite offers optimized pre-trained models, allowing developers to deploy powerful image classification models in mobile apps.

Given sufficient training data, an image classification model can predict whether new images belong to any of the classes it has been trained on. This process, called inference, enables the app to recognize and classify images. Additionally, TensorFlow Lite supports transfer learning, which allows the identification of new image classes without requiring an extensive training dataset.
